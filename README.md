# Polka

Development configuration for setting up and tracking dotfiles in a development
environment. This is a opinionated setup that uses ansible to configure a local
machine.

##WARNING!##

If you are not comfortable with the idea that polka completely nukes and
rebuilds your dotfiles, walk quickly away, and continue to live a normal,
uninteresting life. If you are not afraid, this isn't your first rodeo, and
you're ready for the best terminal experience of your life, read onâ€¦

Polka *will* nuke your current dotfiles, so first make sure to back up any
macros, settings, and configurations you want to keep.

* Ansible
